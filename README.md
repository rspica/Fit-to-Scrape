# All the News that's Fit to Scrape
a web app that lets users leave comments on the latest news. This uses Mongoose and Cheerio to scrape news from another site.

#### Instructions

1. Whenever a user visits your site, the app will scrape stories from a predetermined news outlet. The data includes a link to the story and a headline.

2. Cheerio is used to grab the site content and Mongoose to save it to your MongoDB database. 

3. All users can leave comments on the stories collected during the scrape. They should also be allowed to delete whatever comments they want removed. All stored comments should be visible to every user.
